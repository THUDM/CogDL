## Getting Started

### Requirements and Installation

- Python version >= 3.7
- PyTorch version >= 1.7.1

Please follow the instructions here to install PyTorch (https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch#installation).

When PyTorch has been installed, cogdl can be installed using pip as follows:

```bash
pip install cogdl
```

Install from source via:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/thudm/cogdl.git
```

Or clone the repository and install with the following commands:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:THUDM/cogdl.git
cd cogdl
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### API Usage

You can run all kinds of experiments through CogDL APIs, especially `experiment`. You can also use your own datasets and models for experiments. 
A quickstart example can be found in the [quick_start.py](https://github.com/THUDM/cogdl/tree/master/examples/quick_start.py). More examples are provided in the [examples/](https://github.com/THUDM/cogdl/tree/master/examples/).

```python
from cogdl import experiment

# basic usage
experiment(dataset="cora", model="gcn")

# set other hyper-parameters
experiment(dataset="cora", model="gcn", hidden_size=32, epochs=200)

# run over multiple models on different seeds
experiment(dataset="cora", model=["gcn", "gat"], seed=[1, 2])

# automl usage
def search_space(trial):
    return {
        "lr": trial.suggest_categorical("lr", [1e-3, 5e-3, 1e-2]),
        "hidden_size": trial.suggest_categorical("hidden_size", [32, 64, 128]),
        "dropout": trial.suggest_uniform("dropout", 0.5, 0.8),
    }

experiment(dataset="cora", model="gcn", seed=[1, 2], search_space=search_space)
```

Some interesting applications can be used through `pipeline` API. An example can be found in the [pipeline.py](https://github.com/THUDM/cogdl/tree/master/examples/pipeline.py). 

```python
from cogdl import pipeline

# load OAGBert model and perform inference
oagbert = pipeline("oagbert")
outputs = oagbert(["CogDL is developed by KEG, Tsinghua.", "OAGBert is developed by KEG, Tsinghua."])
```

More details of the OAGBert usage can be found [here](./cogdl/oag/README.md).

### Command-Line Usage

You can also use `python scripts/train.py --dataset example_dataset --model example_model` to run example_model on example_data.

- --dataset, dataset name to run, can be a list of datasets with space like `cora citeseer`. Supported datasets include
'cora', 'citeseer', 'pumbed', 'ppi', 'wikipedia', 'blogcatalog', 'flickr'. More datasets can be found in the [cogdl/datasets](https://github.com/THUDM/cogdl/tree/master/cogdl/datasets).
- --model, model name to run, can be a list of models like `gcn gat`. Supported models include
'gcn', 'gat', 'graphsage', 'deepwalk', 'node2vec', 'hope', 'grarep', 'netmf', 'netsmf', 'prone'. More models can be found in the [cogdl/models](https://github.com/THUDM/cogdl/tree/master/cogdl/models).

For example, if you want to run GCN and GAT on the Cora dataset, with 5 different seeds:

```bash
python scripts/train.py --dataset cora --model gcn gat --seed 0 1 2 3 4
```

Expected output:

| Variant          | test_acc       | val_acc        |
|------------------|----------------|----------------|
| ('cora', 'gcn')  | 0.8050¬±0.0047  | 0.7940¬±0.0063  |
| ('cora', 'gat')  | 0.8234¬±0.0042  | 0.8088¬±0.0016  |

If you have ANY difficulties to get things working in the above steps, feel free to open an issue. You can expect a reply within 24 hours.

How to enable fast GNN training?
</summary>
<br/>
CogDL provides a fast sparse matrix-matrix multiplication operator called [GE-SpMM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03179) to speed up training of GNN models on the GPU. 
You can set `fast_spmm=True` in the API usage or `--fast-spmm` in the command-line usage to enable this feature.
Note that this feature is still in testing and may not work under some versions of CUDA.

How to use models from other libraries?
</summary>
<br/>
If you are familiar with other popular graph libraries, you can implement your own model in CogDL using modules from PyTorch Geometric (PyG).
For the installation of PyG, you can follow the instructions from PyG (https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric/#installation).
For the quick-start usage of how to use layers of PyG, you can find some examples in the [examples/pyg](https://github.com/THUDM/cogdl/tree/master/examples/pyg/).

How to make a successful pull request with unit test
</summary>
<br/>
To have a successful pull request, you need to have at least (1) your model implementation and (2) a unit test.

You might be confused why your pull request was rejected because of 'Coverage decreased ...' issue even though your model is working fine locally. This is because you have not included a unit test, which essentially runs through the extra lines of code you added. The Travis CI service used by Github conducts all unit tests on the code you committed and checks how many lines of the code have been checked by the unit tests, and if a significant portion of your code has not been checked (insufficient coverage), the pull request is rejected.

So how do you do a unit test? 

* Let's say you implement a GNN model in a script `models/nn/abcgnn.py` that does the task of node classification. Then, you need to add a unit test inside the script `tests/tasks/test_node_classification.py` (or whatever relevant task your model does). 
* To add the unit test, you simply add a function *test_abcgnn_cora()* (just follow the format of the other unit tests already in the script), fill it with required arguments and the last line in the function *'assert 0 <= ret["Acc"] <= 1'* is the very basic sanity check conducted by the unit test. 
* After modifying `tests/tasks/test_node_classification.py`, commit it together with your `models/nn/abcgnn.py` and your pull request should pass.
