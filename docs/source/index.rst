CogDL is a graph representation learning toolkit that allows researchers and developers to easily train and compare baseline or customized models for node classification, graph classification, and other important tasks in the graph domain. 

We summarize the contributions of CogDL as follows:

- **High Efficiency**: CogDL utilizes well-optimized operators to speed up training and save GPU memory of GNN models.
- **Easy-to-Use**: CogDL provides easy-to-use APIs for running experiments with the given models and datasets using hyper-parameter search.
- **Extensibility**: The design of CogDL makes it easy to apply GNN models to new scenarios based on our framework.
- **Reproducibility**: CogDL provides reproducible leaderboards for state-of-the-art models on most of important tasks in the graph domain.

‚ùó News
------------

- The new **v0.4.1 release** adds the implementation of Deep GNNs and the recommendation task. It also supports new pipelines for generating embeddings and recommendation. Welcome to join our tutorial on KDD 2021 at 10:30 am - 12:00 am, Aug. 14th (Singapore Time). More details can be found in https://kdd2021graph.github.io/. üéâ
- The new **v0.4.0 release** refactors the data storage (from ``Data`` to ``Graph``) and provides more fast operators to speed up GNN training. It also includes many self-supervised learning methods on graphs. BTW, we are glad to announce that we will give a tutorial on KDD 2021 in August. Please see this `link <https://kdd2021graph.github.io/>`_ for more details. üéâ
- The new **v0.3.0 release** provides a fast spmm operator to speed up GNN training. We also release the first version of `CogDL paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00959>`_ in arXiv. You can join `our slack <https://join.slack.com/t/cogdl/shared_invite/zt-b9b4a49j-2aMB035qZKxvjV4vqf0hEg>`_ for discussion. üéâüéâüéâ
- The new **v0.2.0 release** includes easy-to-use ``experiment`` and ``pipeline`` APIs for all experiments and applications. The ``experiment`` API supports automl features of searching hyper-parameters. This release also provides ``OAGBert`` API for model inference (``OAGBert`` is trained on large-scale academic corpus by our lab). Some features and models are added by the open source community (thanks to all the contributors üéâ).
- The new **v0.1.2 release** includes a pre-training task, many examples, OGB datasets, some knowledge graph embedding methods, and some graph neural network models. The coverage of CogDL is increased to 80%. Some new APIs, such as ``Trainer`` and ``Sampler``, are developed and being tested. 
- The new **v0.1.1 release** includes the knowledge link prediction task, many state-of-the-art models, and ``optuna`` support. We also have a `Chinese WeChat post <https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/IUh-ctQwtSXGvdTij5eDDg>`_ about the CogDL release.
