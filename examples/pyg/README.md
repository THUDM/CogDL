# Running experiments with PyG modules

If you are familiar with other popular graph libraries, you can implement your own model in CogDL using modules from PyTorch Geometric (PyG).

## Installation
For the installation of PyG, you can follow the instructions from PyG (https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric/#installation).

## Usage
For the quick-start usage of how to use layers of PyG, you can find some examples in the this folder.
For example, just run
```bash
python gcn.py
```
